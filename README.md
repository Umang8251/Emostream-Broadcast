# EC-Team-22-emostream-concurrent-emoji-broadcast-over-event-driven-architecture

Designed and implemented a scalable system that enhances the viewer experience on platforms like Hotstar by capturing and processing billions of user-generated emojis in real time during live sporting events. This will involve creating a horizontally scalable architecture using frameworks such as Kafka for data streaming and Spark for real-time data processing. The system will enable high concurrency and low latency, ensuring user interactions are seamless.
